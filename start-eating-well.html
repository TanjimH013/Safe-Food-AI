            Staples to Include in a Healthy Diet
          </h2>
          <div class="start-eating-well-img">
            <img
              src="/Project/Safe-Food-Responsive/IMG/Start eating well/start-eating-well.jpg"

            <p class="eating-well-paragraph">
              Planning a healthy diet can seem like a complicated task, but if
              you start with the essentials, you know you always have the basics
              in the house to make healthy food and plan meals. Not only does
              this keep your diet under control, but it also keeps your weekly
              grocery budget controlled.
            </p>

            <h2 class="eating-well-subheading">Plenty of Lentils</h2>

            <p class="eating-well-paragraph">
              Whether you are on a meat-based diet or a plant-based diet, it’s a
              great idea to have plenty of lentils in your kitchen as a staple
              food item. Lentils are extremely healthy; they are packed fiber,
              protein, and healthy carbs to ensure you stay healthy and strong
              whatever you plan to cook.<br /><br />
              The other reason to have plenty of lentils in the kitchen is that
              there is no shortage of things you can make with them. Whether you
              like lentil soup, chilli, curry, or you want to make a cottage pie
              or lasagne, include plenty of lentils to boost your protein intake
              and lower your cholesterol.
            </p>

            <h2 class="eating-well-subheading">Quality Meats</h2>

            <p class="eating-well-paragraph">
              If you eat meat, it’s easier for you to get the proteins and
              minerals you need to support a healthy body and brain. Meat is a
              rich source of protein, but it’s also an excellent source of zinc,
              iron, B vitamins, and vitamin B12. However, you need to make sure
              you are eating high-quality meats.<br />
              <br />
              While all meats contain levels of nutrition, some are better than
              others. Processed meats, for example, are made up of additives and
              meat combinations that reduce their nutritional value.
              Alternatively, the quality meat used to make this chicken parmesan
              recipe is wholesome food.
            </p>

            <h2 class="eating-well-subheading">Frozen Veggies</h2>

            <p class="eating-well-paragraph">
              We all know that a healthy diet consists of vegetables, but it’s
              not always easy to include vegetables in your meals because they
              are highly perishable. Unless you eat vegetables within a couple
              of days, they start to rot, and you have to throw them out, but
              there’s an alternative.<br />
              <br />
              Don’t buy fresh vegetables; instead, buy bags of frozen veggies
              and store them in your freezer. Any time you need nutritious
              veggies for your home-cooked meals, all you have to do is open the
              freezer and defrost them in some hot water. It’s a convenient,
              practical, nutritious system.
            </p>

            <h2 class="eating-well-subheading">Plenty of Grains</h2>

            <p class="eating-well-paragraph">
              There’s a reason why grains were such an important part of the
              human diet historically; it’s because they are excellent for
              health, and they last for months or years without going bad. Not
              only that, grains taste nice, and you can make all kinds of meals
              from them during the week.<br />
              <br />
              Some of the best grains to include in your kitchen are brown rice,
              which is nutritious and tasty, oats that are excellent for your
              morning meal and can be made into various snacks and baked goods;
              and quinoa which is a super food capable of withstanding many
              months unopened.
            </p>

            <h2 class="eating-well-subheading">Frozen Fruits</h2>

            <p class="eating-well-paragraph">
              As with frozen veggies, it pays to have some frozen fruits in your
              freezer as well. Frozen fruits can be kept indefinitely, so you
              always have a selection of nutritional foodstuff to make morning
              smoothies and for baking. You can buy specific berries in bags or
              mixed fruits for summer.
